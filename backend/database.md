# Database

1. **DynamoDB:** Amazon DynamoDB is a serverless, NoSQL, fully managed database service with single-digit millisecond response times at any scale, enabling you to develop and run modern applications while only paying for what you use.

2. **PostgreSQL:**  [https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/what-is-postgresql/)

PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class [open-source](https://aws.amazon.com/products/databases/open-source-databases/) relational database that supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying. It is a highly stable database management system backed by more than 20 years of community development. This thorough and collaborative approach has contributed to its high levels of resilience, integrity, and correctness. PostgreSQL is used as the primary data store or [data warehouse](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/data-warehouse/) for many web, mobile, geospatial, and analytics applications.  PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDMBS), which means that it has relational capabilities and an object-oriented design.

3. **MySQL:** MySQL is an open-source relational database management system.
4. **GraphQL:** GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a query runtime engine. GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where a client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API.
5. **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a source-available, cross-platform, document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database product, MongoDB utilizes JSON-like documents with optional schemas.
6. **SQL vs NoSQL:** SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language with a traditional approach that allows relational databases that model predefined schemas to manage structured data like rows and tables. On the other hand, NoSQL, which stands for "Not Only SQL," offers a more flexible, non-relational approach, ideal for handling unstructured or dynamic data. As businesses evolve and data becomes increasingly diverse, understanding the core differences between SQL and NoSQL is important.

**The five critical differences between SQL and NoSQL are:**

* SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational.
* SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
* SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
* SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
* SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

7. **Severless:** [**https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless**](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless)

Serverless is a [cloud-native](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps) development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A [cloud provider](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-providers) handles the routine work of [provisioning](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation/what-is-provisioning), maintaining, and scaling the server [infrastructure](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-it-infrastructure). Developers can simply package their code in [containers](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers) for deployment.

Once deployed, serverless apps respond to demand and [automatically](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/automation) scale up and down as needed. Serverless offerings from [public cloud](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-is-public-cloud) providers are usually metered on-demand through an [event-driven](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/integration/what-is-event-driven-architecture) execution model. As a result, when a serverless function is sitting idle, it doesnâ€™t cost anything.
